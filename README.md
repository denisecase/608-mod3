Example of a custom object in Python

To create re-usable code, we often create "objects".   We can reuse these objects by making instances (much like we purchase an instance of a general  make and model of a car. 

Our focus in this module is functions - so mostly we're interested in how to call functions defined in an object.  Functions defined in an object are called the object's methods. 

Here's an example. We create a Purchase object for a given amount. Pass in the amount (in this case, $100) as a single argument when we create our instance.  Then, we can define the tax for our location and our preferred tip as percentages. We can use the Purchase methods to calculate tax, tip, and the new total. 

Objects need a __init__ function defined - this is used when we initialize a new instance of our object. 

Here's a working example - you can run it in Anaconda, in Jupyter, or online with the Online Python 3 Compiler at <https://www.jdoodle.com/python3-programming-online/>.
